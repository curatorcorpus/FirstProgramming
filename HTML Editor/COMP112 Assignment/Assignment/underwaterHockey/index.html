	<p><em>Underwater Hockey</em> is a fast, competitive underwater sport in which teams of six players attempt to propel a small lead puck into their opponentâ€™s goal. Members of the Southsea Dive Club in Southern England invented UWH in 1954. It was intended as an off-season activity for fitness and to help maintain club membership during the cold winter months.
