				<p>Underwater Hockey is played by two teams of six <strong>with up to four subs per team</strong> in <strong>(ideally)</strong> a <em>25m x 15m pool</em> with a constant depth of between <em>2m and 3.5m.</em> Teams may be and often are, mixed gender. A <em>3.5m</em> wide goal or gully is placed on the bottom at either end of the playing area. Players are equipped with a mask and snorkel, fins, a water-polo style hat (to protect your ears) and a underwater hockey stick and a padded glove (to protect your delicate fingers).
				</p>
				<p>At the beginning of a game, the two teams start on the surface touching the pool side at their respective ends. The puck is placed in the middle of the playing area. At the sound of the <em>gong, whistle, bell or hooter</em> members of each team will swim toward the centre and attempt to gain control of the puck. The puck is then propelled or passed from player to player using the stick only in attempt to put it through the opponent's goal.
				</p>
				<p>Underwater Hockey is a non-contact sport, in the same way soccer is, and as a result <strong>injuries are uncommon and usually minor</strong>. The rules of Underwater Hockey are fairly simple to regular hockey. However there is no off-side rule, <strong>(i.e. the puck may be passed in any direction)</strong> it is an easy sport to learn.
