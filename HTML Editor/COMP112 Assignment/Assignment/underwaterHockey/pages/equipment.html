			<p>You need a small amount of equipment to play underwater hockey. In all cases the better the gear you buy the better it will perform and generally, the longer it will last.
			</p>
			<div id="equipment_list">
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Togs: </strong><br>
						Goes without saying, I hope. Togs will be required. Speedos for chaps, one-piece swimsuit for women. Don't try shorts and/or t-shirt; the drag generated by baggy clothing is prohibitive.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Mask: </strong><br>
						Well fitting. low volume. Make sure you have reasonable peripheral vision, otherwise other players can creep up un-noticed. Make sure that there is a pillar between the two eye pieces. The glass must be saftey glass
					</li>
					<li><strong>Snorkel: </strong><br>
						<div id="snorkel_picture">
							<a href="../images/snorkel.jpg"><img src="../images/snorkel.jpg" alt="snorkel.jpg" width="135" height="90"></a>
						</div>
						The biggest bore snorkel you can get. Don't get one with fancy valves or other gizmos, just one that allows you to get air in at the maximum
						possible rate. You'll thank me for this later.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Hat: </strong><br>
						A water-polo style hat with ear protectors
					</li>
					<li><strong>Gloves: </strong><br>
						<a href="../images/gloves.jpg"><img src="../images/gloves.jpg" alt="gloves.jpg" width="135" height="90"></a>
						Gloves are worn on the hand holding your stick. It two purposes:
						<ul>
							<li>To protect your knuckles from the bottom of the pool. Some of the tiles have small chips on them and they are very sharp to the unprotected knuckle.
							</li>
							<li>To protect your fingers and you entire hands when they are inevitably hit by either the puck or another player's stick.
							</li>
						</ul>
						Buy one. Saves a lot of time and mess. You can buy them online for about $50
					</li>
					<li><strong>Stick: </strong><br>
						<a href="../images/sticks.jpg"><img src="../images/sticks.jpg" alt="sticks.jpg" width="135" height="90"></a>
						In the old days, people used to carve their own sticks out of bits of hard wood. Nowadays sticks are made of composite plastic and are available in a multitude of sizes and styles
					</li>
					<li><strong>Fins*: </strong><br>
						<a href="../images/fins.jpg"><img src="../images/fins.jpg" alt="fins.jpg" width="135" height="90"></a>
						There are many styles of fins that vary wildy in price. The expensive fins are not always the best fins for you. If at all possible, try a variety of fins (ask people at the club to find the best fitting one for your swimming).
						<br>
						<br>
						<em>*The things you wear on your feet are called fins, not flippers.</em>
