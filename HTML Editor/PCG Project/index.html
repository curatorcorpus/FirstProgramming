		<h2>General Information on Computers</h2>
		<p><strong>Welcome to Park's computer guide</strong> for all people. This website helps computer enthusiasts on their building option and informs the different hardware option that people can take for making the best customed computer rig, work station computers, servers or other computers for personal neeeds.<p>
			<h3>Gaming Computer</h3>
			<figure id="gamingcomputer"><a href="http://elitegamingcomputers.com/jeffs-awesome-gaming-computer/"><img src="./images/index_images/awesome_rig.jpg" alt="awesome_rig.jpg" width="600" height="400" title="elite_gaming_computers"><br>Gaming Computers</a>
			</figure>
			<p>Gaming computers are machines that are optimised to run video games. As time goes by computers are becoming more sophisticated and powerful. Which leads to computers requiring better hardware to compensate for power demands. It is amazing to see how much gaming computers have evolved along with the technological advancements. A wikipedia article shows that:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<em>"By 1993, Computer Gaming World stated in January saying it would be a mistake to get anything less than 386 clone with, at least a clock speed of 33 mhz. If possible, get a 486 clone with a faster speed. get four megabytes of RAM and at least 100MB on your hard disk. If you've never dealth with a C> prompt before, do yourself and favour and put windows on the machines as your primary interface. If you're comfortable with the same DOS that you see on your friends' machine, go with DOS 5.0. Get a mouse, if you can afford it, and a sound card that is either AdLib or Soundblaster compatible. If you do win the lottery, throw in a CD-ROM, too. That's the basic game machine for today's games."</em></blockquote>
				<p>This shows the standards of the computer gaming machines just before 1993. As a comparison its states how 'if possible, get four megabytes of RAM and at least 100MB Hard Disk'. Now today 4MB of RAM and 100MB of Hard Disk storage is child's play but this was just to show how far we have gotten with computer technology. Computers are becoming faster and a lot specified as the technological development advances.<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaming_computer"><br>Click Here for more information</a></p>

				<h3>Work Station Computers</h3>
				<figure id="workstationcomputer"><a href="http://www.techeblog.com/index.php/tech-gadget/24-awesome-computer-workstations"><img src="./images/index_images/awesome_computer_workstation.jpg" alt="awesome_wokrstation_computer" width="400" height="300" title="workstation_computers"><br>Workstation Computers</a>
				</figure>
				<p>These types of computer are designed for scientific or technical work.
					For example <em>3D modelling, rendering, and design.</em> These computer are designed for specified work and are mainly different in some of the specifications. It would be optimal for workstation computers to have high capacity RAM, and Hard drive, multi-core Central Processing Unit (CPU) and a design appropriate graphics card. the high capacity RAM and hard drive will allow for smooth multi-tasking and larger storage. Particularly if you have a <em>solid state hard drive</em> it would improve file transfer speeds -both uploarding and downloading. This is crucial for workstation computers because a lot of the work involved with large amounts of data, <em>eg. 3D modelling</em></p>

					<br>
					<h3>Server Computers</h3>
					<figure id="servercomputer"><a href="http://www.treehugger.com/clean-technology/number-of-the-day-118-million.html"><img src="./images/index_images/servers_image.jpg" alt="server_computers" width="600" height="400" title="server_computers"><br>Server Computers</a>
					</figure>
					<p>Server computers are designed to run constantly so that people have access to them anytime. Of course there are boundaries as to what you can access but generally servers are used for the storage of large amounts of data. It is connected to the internet and so that people have access to the files in the storage over the TCP/IP protocol. All servers mainly need a high central processing unit power and server board with potentially high capacity ram and add ons for high bandwidth network connections. Most servers hosts <strong> database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, gaming servers, and application servers.</strong> there are many examples of these that will be explained later on. </p>
