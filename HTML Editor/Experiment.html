     Frederic Francois Chopin was a Polish composer and virtuoso pianist of the Romantic era, 
     who wrote primarily for the solo piano. He gained and has maintained renown worldwide 
     as one of the leading musicians of his era, whose <em>"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation."</em>Chopin was born in what was then the Duchy of Warsaw, and grew up in Warsaw, which after 1815 became part of <strong>Congress Poland.</strong> A<em>child prodigy,</em> he completed his musical education and composed many of his works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the ages of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the November 1830 Uprising.</p>
     <p>At the age of 21 he settled in Paris. Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for  which he was in high demand. Chop informed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including <strong>Robert Schumann.</strong>In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to a Polish girl, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer <em>George Sand.</em> A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838-39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of <strong>tuberculosis.</strong></p>
     <p>All of Chopin;s compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two 
      piano concertos, a few chamber pieces, and some songs to Polish lyrics. His keyboard style is highly 
      individual and often technically demanding; his own performances were noted for their nuance and 
      sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of instrumental ballade. His major piano works also include sonatas, mazurkas, waltzes, nocturnes, polonaises, etudes, impromptu, scherzos, and preludes, some published only after his death. Many contain elements of both Polish folk music and of the classical tradition of J.S. Bach, Mozart and Schubert,the music of all of whom he admired. His innovations in style, musical form, and harmony, and his association of music with nationalism, were influential throughout and after late Romantic period.</p>
      <p>Both in his native Poland and beyond, Chopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his association (if only indirect) with political insurrection, his love life and his early death have made him, in the public consciousness, a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of numerous films and biographies of varying degrees of historical accuracy.</p>

      <h2>Death</h2>
      <p>With his health further deteriorating. Chopin desired to have a family member with him. In June 1849 his sister Ludwika came to Paris with her husband and daughter, and in September, supported by a loan from Jane Stirling, he took an apartment at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_Vend%C3%B4me">Place Vendome 12</a>. After 15 October, when his coniditon took a marked turn for the worse, only a handful of his closest friends remained with him, although Viardot remarked sardonically that:
        <blockquote> 
         "all the grand Parisian ladies considered it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_rigueur">de rigueur</a> to faint in his room."
       </blockquote>
     </p>
     <p>Some of his friends provided music at his request, among them, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delfina_Potocka">Potocka</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_Franchomme">Franchomme</a> played the cello. Chopin requested that his body be opened after death (for fear of being buried alive) and his heart returned to Warsaw. He also bequeathed his unfinished notes on a piano tuition method. <em>Projet de methode</em>, to Alkan for completion. On 17 October, after midnight, the physician leaned over him and asked whether he was suffering greatly. <strong>"No longer"</strong>, he replied. He died a few minutes before two o'clock in the morning. Those present at the deathbed appear to have included his sister Ludwika, Princess Marcelina Czartoryska, Sand's daughter Solange, and Thomas Albercht. Later that morning, Solange's husband Clesinger made Chopin's death mask and cast of his left hand.</p>
